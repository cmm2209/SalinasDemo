  <h3 class="child-flex1">That the musical instruments which we use have nearly all imperfect consonances, and they are derived from a perfect instrument by the distribution of commas, but not all in the same way.

  <h3 class="child-flex1a">Quod Musica, quibus vtimur, instrumenta imperfectas habent fere omnes consonantias, et ab instrumento perfecto deriuantur per Commatis distributionem, sed non omnia eodem modo.</h3> 
  </div>
<div class="parentTranslation">
  <p class="child-flex1">So far we have spoken about the most fitting tuning system of the musical tones, which the Greeks call hermosmenon.  Nothing can be invented more exactly or perfectly than that system, neither for the sense of hearing (due to the all-embracing perfection of the consonances) nor, unless I am mistaken, for the sense of vision (due to the greatest agreement of the parts, whose distances from each other are determined by established ratios, as can be seen in figures), nor for the understanding (due to the most precise relations of exemplary numbers and ratios).  Now we must show how the musical instruments that we use deviate from that perfect natural tuning system, and why their consonances are nearly all imperfect, and are not constituted in their true forms and correct ratios.</p>
  <p class="child-flex1a">HActenus a nobis de aptissimo vocum temperamento (quod [hermosmenon] Graeci vocant) habitus est sermo, quo nihil exactius, aut perfectius excogitari potest, vel ad audiendum propter omnimodam consonantiarum perfectionem; vel ad videndum (ni fallor) propter maximam partium debita inuicem proportione distantium conuenientiam, vt in typis conspici potest; vel ad intelligendum propter exactissimam numerorum, et proportionum exemplarium rationem. nunc ostendendum est nobis, quonam pacto ab illo deriuentur Musica, quibus vtimur, instrumenta; et quare haec prope omnes consonantias habeant imperfectas, et non in suis veris formis, et legitimis proportionibus constitutas.</p>

  <p class="child-flex1">
	In order to understand that better it is necessary to know that musical instruments exist in two kinds: for they first are either natural or artificial.  Natural instruments, like human voices, are suited by a natural ability for singing, but artificial ones, like organs and 
<span class="gloss-container">
  <span class="glossed">citharas<span class="glosser">Ancient Greek stringed instrument</span> </span>
</span>
     and others of that kind, are created by humans to resemble human voices.  But human voices can easily be adjusted with regard to pitch, because by the leading of reason, owing to the power of harmony naturally implanted in them, they always choose what is perfect, and are able to hold firm on a pitch wherever they wish, and because they keep all consonances in a song (and all smaller intervals) in proper proportions according to the nature of the harmonic numbers.  This happens unless some impediment intervenes, due to which the voices cannot do that, as when they are joined with artificial instruments, for then they are compelled to follow their imperfect consonances and intervals.  When [the instruments] depart from them, they return to the intervals which are true and natural to them, (just as water seeks the property of fire when fire is laid below, being heated by it; but when the fire is removed it returns to the coldness which is natural to it).  Whence in song it is unnecessary that practitioners indicate smaller semitones: as much those which are made lower by a <span class="gloss-container">
  <span class="glossed">b<span class="glosser">predecessor of the flat sign</span></span>
</span> as those which are said to be held up by four lines, #.  This is because that voice which is led from other consonances naturally makes smaller semitones, as we experience in cadences, in which instead of a tone a semitone is made by raising the voice, even though it is not indicated.  And from F to B, not <span class="gloss-container">
  <span class="glossed">hard B<span class="glosser">predecessor of B natural</span></span></span> but 
	<span class="gloss-container">
  <span class="glossed">soft B<span class="glosser">predecessor of B flat</span></span>
</span> sounds, even if there is not the soft B [symbol] in order that the harshness of the tritone is avoided and the consonant fourth is caused to resound.</p>
  <p class="child-flex1a">Quod vt melius intelligatur, scire oportet, instrumenta Musica in duplici consistere differentia. Nam primum aut sunt naturalia, aut artificialia. Naturalia quidem, vt voces humanae, quae naturali facultate ad canendum aptae sunt: Artificialia vero, vt Organa, et Citharae, atque alia id genus, quae ad vocum humanarum similitudinem ab hominibus inuenta sunt. Sed voces humanae facile flecti possunt, quoniam et ratione duce propter harmoniae vim sibi naturaliter insitam semper eligunt, quod perfectum est, vbicunque volunt, valent consistere: et omnes consonantias, atque omnia minora interualla in suis legitimis proportionibus iuxta numerorum harmonicorum naturam in cantu custodiunt; nisi aliquod interueniat impedimentum, propter quod id facere non possint, vt cum artificialibus applicantur instrumentis, tunc enim eorum imperfectas consonantias, atque interualla sequi coguntur; a quibus cum recendunt, ad vera, et sibi naturalia redeunt interualla. Quemadmodum aqua, igni supposita, sequitur ignis proprietatem, ab eo calefacta; sed igne sublato, ad sibi naturalem redit frigiditatem. Vnde in cantu nihil opus esse arbitrati sunt Practici signare Semitonia minora, tam quae per b remittuntur, quam quae per quatuor virgulas, #, sustineri dicuntur: quoniam ipsa vox tracta ab alijs consonantibus ea Semitonia minora naturaliter efficit, vt experimur in clausulis, in quibus ex Tono Semitonium fit per vocis intensionem, quamuis signatum non sit. Et ab F ad b non durum, sed molle sonat, etiamsi b molle non sit; vt fugiatur Tritoni durities, et Diatessaron consonantia compleatur.</p>

    That cannot be done in artificial instruments unless there are <span class="gloss-container">
  <span class="glossed">black plectra<span class="glosser">keys for playing accidentals</span></span>
</span>, with which the artist tries, as much as human zeal allows, to imitate the singing of the human voice.  But in singing, even though the intervals are arranged correctly (especially in the diatonic genus, which <span class="gloss-container">
  <span class="glossed">Boethius<span class="glosser">(c. 480-523 C.E.) author of a widely read music treatise (see XXX)</span></span>

  <span class="glossed">ditone<span class="glosser">major third</span></span>
</span> is always divided into two whole tones of which one is larger and the other smaller, nonetheless neither is it the case that the larger precedes and the smaller follows, nor the contrary. Rather, it is the singer’s choice which of them to utter lower or higher, as the other vocal parts and the melody itself seem to require.  But we cannot do that on a perfect instrument, since from F to G the larger tone is found, and by no means the smaller one; and from G to A is a smaller tone, and never a larger.  And because it very often happens that a smaller tone ought to be made from F to G, and a larger one from G to A (which, as was said, cannot be found on a perfect instrument), it was necessary for the craftsperson to make each tone equal, so that the same sound that divides the ditone into two tones would be equally distant from each extreme, and each of the [originally] larger and smaller tones could take the place of either the larger or the smaller.</p>
  <p class="child-flex1a">Quod in artificialibus instrumentis, nisi plectra nigra sint, fieri non potest, in quibus artifex, quantum humana patitur industria, cantum humanae vocis imitari conatus est. Sed in cantu quamquam vere ita disposita sint interualla, (praesertim in genere Diatono, quod maxime naturale Boetius esse ait), vt Ditonum in duos Tonos, alterum maiorem, et alterum minorem, semper diuidatur: non tamen aut maior praecedit, minor sequitur, aut contra. Sed in arbitrio canentis est, vtrum eorum ad graue, vel ad acutum enuntiare malit, vt aliae partes, atque ipsa melodia videbitur postulare. Quod in instrumento perfecto facere non possumus: quoniam ab F ad G ita reperitur maior, vt nequaquam reperiatur minor; et a G ad a minor, et nunquam maior. Et quoniam saepissime accidit, vt ab F ad G modulandus sit Tonus minor, et a G ad a Tonus maior, (quod, vt dictum est, in instrumento perfecto non reperitur) opus fuit, vt artifex vtrumque Tonum aequalem faceret, vt idem sonus, qui Ditonum in duos Tonos diuideret, ab vtroque extremo aeque distaret, et vtrique maior et minor, aut vice maioris, et minoris esse posset.</p>
  </div>
 <div class="parentTranslation">
  <p class="child-flex1">Due to that it was undoubtedly necessary for the craftsperson to shift all consonances (or nearly all) and all intervals from their perfection.  (I say “consonances” in order to exclude the unison and the octave, which is equal-sounding, the former due to its complete equality of sounds, the latter due to the same power of its two extremes, which are always the same and must remain in their proper proportions as much in song as in artificial instruments.)  But one ought to change the remaining intervals so that although one is compelled to lose a little sweetness due to the imperfection, it should by no means offend the sense of hearing.  And because equality of tones is sought by raising by a comma (which is the excess of the larger tone against the smaller, which cannot exist among equals), the three commas by which the three larger tones surpass three smaller ones, should be distributed among them and the remaining smaller intervals; some consonances are thereby increased, and others are decreased.
  </p>
  <p class="child-flex1a">Ad quod vtique faciendum necesse fuit illi, vt omnes, aut fere omnes a sua perfectione consonantias, atque omnia interualla dimoueret. Dico autem consonantias, vt excipiam Vnisonantiam, et Diapason AEquisonantiam; illam propter omnimodam sonorum aequalitatem; hanc propter eandem vim duorum extremorum; quas tam in cantu, quam in artificialibus instrumentis semper easdem esse; et in suis legitimis proportionibus manere, necesse est. Reliquas autem ita immutare debuit, vt quamuis aliquantulum suauitatis propter imperfectionem amittere cogerentur, id aurium sensum neutiquam offenderet. Et quoniam Tonorum aequalitatem sequitur sublatio Commatis, quod est maioris ad minorem excessus, qui inter aequalia nullus esse potest; tria Commata, quibus tres Toni maiores superabant minores, inter eos, et reliqua minora interualla, distribuenda fuerunt: Vnde aliae consonantiae auctae, et aliae diminutae sunt.</p>

  <h3>Commentary</h3>
  <p>Issues of tuning and instruments figure prominently in this passage by Francisco de Salinas (1513¬–1590).  After becoming blind when a child, Salinas received extensive training in the practical and theoretical sides of music.  He was hired as organist at the Cathedral of Sigüenza and then the Cathedral of Léon, and later he was appointed as a professor of music at the University of Salamanca.  In characteristic Renaissance fashion, Salinas studied practically all the Ancient Greek and Latin treatises on music then known, and in his De musica he attempted to provide a comprehensive account of speculative music theory, drawing upon the best sources from Antiquity through his day.</p>
    <p>In this excerpt Salinas addresses tuning systems, particularly the discrepancy between the Ancient Greek systems and various temperaments of Salinas’s day.  To do so, he adopts a classification of musical instruments into two types: natural and artificial.  While this division predates Salinas, as it was first proposed by Al-Farabi in the tenth twelfth century C.E. and then disseminated by Jerome of Moravia, Salinas innovatively applies it in the realm of tuning systems.  He holds that natural instruments, by which he means voices, are flexible enough to sing in just intonation, the innovative tuning system that prioritizes pure-sounding thirds and sixths, which had been developed earlier that century.  Artificial instruments, particularly keyboard and fretted ones (such as the vihuela, a Spanish instrument resembling the guitar and lute), are unable to make the adjustments necessary to guarantee pure-sounding consonances throughout, so Salinas asserts that their tunings should be tempered.</p>
    <p>In the subsequent chapters Salinas explores a variety of options for tempering.  The final two paragraphs of this excerpt introduce the concept of mean-tone temperaments, in which consonances are altered by fractions of the syntonic comma (81:80).  In addition to recounting the quarter-tone and two-sevenths-tone systems of tempering, Salinas proposes a new variety: the third-comma temperament, in which the minor whole tone of just intonation is increased by one-third of a syntonic comma, and the major whole tone is decreased by two-thirds of a comma.  Salinas also sets forth equal temperament schemes, including the division of the 5:4 ditone into two equal tones, and the more significant division of the octave into twelve equal parts.  He describes them with mathematical accuracy, employing Euclid’s method for finding the geometric mean of two values in the case of the ditone, and describing how to use a tool called the mesolabium to divide the octave into twelve equal parts.	  In 1558 Gioseffo Zarlino had employed that instrument to divide the syntonic comma into seven equal parts; Salinas, however, was the first to extend its use to the octave.</p>
